python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Task 4:
spin up your first project
```python
django-admin startproject flexy
```

Task 5:
migrate your models into your database schema
```python
cd flexy
python manage.py migrate 
```

Task 6:
our system shall have a blog so let us create an application called blog
```python
python manage.py startapp blog
```

Task 7:

python manage.py runserver
```

Task 8:

body - **
publish - **
created - **
updated - **
status - **
also return a dunder string that can be a representative of
the model


Task 9:

```

Task 10:
create a post/article
```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from blog.models import Post
user = User.objects.get(username='admin')
post = Post(
        title='Another post',
        slug='another-post',
        body='Post body.',
        author=user

by the admin but exclude all the titles that starts with why and finally return them
arranged in descending order of their title heads

```python
Post.objects.filter(publish__year=2020,author__username='admin')
            .exclude(title__startswith='Why')
            .order_by('-title')
```

 paginator = Paginator(object_list, 3) # 3 posts in each page
 page = request.GET.get('page')
 try:
        posts = paginator.page(page)
 except PageNotAnInteger:
        # If page is not an integer deliver the first page
        posts = paginator.page(1)
 except EmptyPage:
        # If page is out of range deliver last page of results
        posts = paginator.page(paginator.num_pages)
 return render(request,
 'blog/post/list.html',
 {'posts': posts,'page':page})
```

Task 17:
Write a 'pagination.html' file and paste the following code
```python
<div class="pagination">
 <span class="step-links">
 {% if page.has_previous %}
 <a href="?page={{ page.previous_page_number }}">Previous</a>
 {% endif %}
 <span class="current">
 Page {{ page.number }} of {{ page.paginator.num_pages }}.
 </span>
 {% if page.has_next %}
 <a href="?page={{ page.next_page_number }}">Next</a>
 {% endif %}
 </span>
</div>
```

Task 18:
In the post/list.html include the pagination page
